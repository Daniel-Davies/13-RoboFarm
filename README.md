# RoboFarm

This is a paired programming project carried out at the University of California, Irvine, which was a practical application of AI on Microsoft's AI research platform, Malmo.

Malmo is an AI experimentation platform, leveraging the popular game "Minecraft" as a world to run algorithms in. Check out more about it [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/project-malmo/)

## Project

The project our team developed involved implementing a Genetic Algorithm to maximise the efficiency of planting crops in the minecraft game. We researched an adapting multiple variants of the algorithm to gain a successful implementation in the end, and also managed to explore other concepts such as Reinforcement Learing on top of our production implementation.
