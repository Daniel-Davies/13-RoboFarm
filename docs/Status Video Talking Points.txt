Problem Description:
- Finding the optimal places to plant seeds on unseen map for best crop yield
- Limited to 10 seeds on a 10x10 plot of land
- Middle plots are hydrated by central water source
- Crop growth cut at 40 minutes of in-game time

	Factors:
		-Proximity to water (hydrated farmland)
		-Light level (torches, sunlight)
		-Crop formation (single rows encouraged)

Baseline method:
The benchmark for performance on never before seen land is completely random 
seed placement.  

Details:
-Note: Crop growth in Minecraft is probabilistic, meaning that even the best seed
are not guaranteed to produce crops every time.  To account for this we have averaged
the yield for seed placements across multiple sample growth periods.

Approach:
Our team tackled this problem with genetic algorithms.  The initial population of seeds 
is random, but after every run a new generation of seed placements is created by 
crossing the genes of strongly performing seeds of the previous generation.  

-In order to escape local minima, we added mutation logic to rarely shift new seeds one
square in a random direction 
-During gene crossing, the new seed placement inherits coordinates from each parent with
a certain probability, effectively blending the genes that made the original seed 
successful.  
-Over the course of 10 simulated generations, the seed placements slowly cluster toward 
the center of hydrated farmland - the optimal seed placements.

Future plans:
Over the next few weeks we intend to add the more complex and nuanced factors of Minecraft
farming into our genetic algorithm's logic, such as crop formation, torch placement and
bonemeal.  After those additions, we will continue to experiment with interesting map
formations to challenge our algorithm to learn and adapt.
