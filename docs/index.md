What is RoboFarm?

Farming in Minecraft can be quite a time consuming process:
We may have to wait whole day cycles to get a few crops. So to
make the process we have made a tool that allows an AI to do the
farming process for you and save more time for you to do whatever 
else you want to do in the game.

We have prepared a number of goals to reach:

- MVP: We want the AI to realise that planting in Rock is bad and in Grass is good
- Then hopefully we can allow our AI to start optimising by realising ploughed grass is even better
- Finally we will try and allow the AI to reach optimal farming methods, e.g., using Bone Meal to speed things up
