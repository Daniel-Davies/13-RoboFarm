            <h1>Summary of the project</h1>
            <p>We are essentially creating an AI to find the best points of farmland on a map to plant wheat crops in. Results
                from farming in minecraft can vary greatly based on a number of criteria, which our agent will use to evaluate
                positions on the map, and eventually select the optimum locations for farming. The criteria include:</p>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Terrain: which block you place seeds on directly influences crop yield</li>
                <li>Proximity to water: the closer to a river/water, the faster crops grow</li>
                <li>Light: even if artificial, more light generally means a higher crop yield</li>
                <li>Material Additions: Materials like Bone Meal can help make crop yield faster</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Given these criteria, we are using a Genetic Algorithm to search for the optimal planting positions for wheat
                crops in a minecraft world to get a maximum amount of crop yield for a given time frame </p>


            <h1>Approach</h1>
            <p>We will be using a Genetic Algorithm to solve this problem, which essentially involves mapping the problem to
                a graph search problem and following the procedure for a genetic algorithm to allow our seeds to converge
                onto an optimal location.
            </p>
            <h5>Setup</h5>
            <p>To set the agent up with what it needs, we do the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>First, for this MVP version of our project, we generate a very simple world, which is essentally a square
                    grid containing:
                    <ol>
                        <li>A water square at (0,0)</li>
                        <li>Dirt around the water from (-10,10) in the (x,z) directions</li>
                    </ol>
                    This has the implication of creating
                    <em>hydrated</em> water from (-4,4) by [aka the "optimal" part of the map and where plants will grow fastest]
                    and leaving the remaining dirt squares as dry, and non optimal to plant on.
                </li>
                <li>The agent is given a range of squares to plant in, which for our purposes, is any of the squares in (-10,10):
                    the agent is successful if he puts a majority of the seeds in the hydrated square region at the end of
                    the algorithm
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Now our agent is given 10 seeds, and can do one of 2 methods:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>we wrote a function that plants seeds randomly, to measure a baseline performace. In a world of (-10,10)
                    dirt blocks,discluding the water block at the center, our agent can plant on 21*21 - 1 squares = 440,
                    of which (-4,4) -> 9*9 - 1 = 80 are plantable. So theoretically, 18% is the random agent success rate
                    for this map
                </li>
                <li>Plant using our algorithm, which is discussed below, and evaluated against this random agent</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Algorithm</h5>
            <p>Our algorithm essentially simulates placing the seeds on the map, and evaluates this potential placement using
                our scoring function. It will do this until convergence. The steps are as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>We initialise 10 random seed locations [this could be any integer value less than the map area], stored as
                    (x,z) tuples [Y is implicityly the same as we do no digging]</li>
                <li>For 10 rounds, we do:
                    <ul>
                        <li>score the current seed locations using our scoring function, which essentially measures distance
                            to the nearest water block</li>
                        <li>take 5 "elite" seeds: that is, the best scoring seeds from the group. These 5 seeds automatically
                            pass to the next round of seed locations
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            using the same 5 best seeds, generate 5 new children seeds by using their attributes. In this simple version of our algorithm,
                            we essentially randomly take the x and z co-ordinate from either of the parents. This is a simple
                            approach, but is quite effective is generating good results, accoring to
                            <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/gads/how-the-genetic-algorithm-works.html">here</a>
                        </li>
                        <li>The 5 best seed locations are taken along with the new 5 children, ready for the next round. The
                            worst 5 "die"</li>
                        <li>Randomly mutate one of the seed locations by adding a mutation vector, which for now, adds [[-3 to
                            3],[-3 to 3]] to a seed location</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>At the end of the generation of seed locations, we have a list of (x,z) pairs to place our seeds. We then
                    plant these, and calculate how many were placed in the (-4,4) farmland section
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Remaining Goals and Challenges</h1>
            <p>At the moment we have a very basic algorithm that will give us a better score than randomly placing seeds, but
                we have identified three main points of improvment</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Making the planting real</b>
                    <p>
                        At the moment, our algorithm can be run fully out of malmo: we give it an array of where the locations of each block type
                        are, and a scoring function, and the algorithm will give the best locations to place seeds after
                        running some number of rounds consecutively.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So essentially this relies entirely on our score function: if the scoring function models the map sufficiently well, the
                        plants will grow optimally. However, this doesnt scale/ would be quite complex to build. For now,
                        we can only model distances from interesting squares, for example, the score we are currently using
                        is distance from the nearest water block. But minecraft farming depends on much more than this: a
                        torch in the neighbouring square to a crop will make it grow faster, which our score function will
                        not pick up, and so if on a map a seed is planted nearby a torch, the model could assign it a bad
                        score, despite it being a good square to plant on.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This is where the malmo APIs could become useful: after each round of the genetic algorithm, we could
                        <em>actually plant</em>
                        at the locations generated by the algorithm for that round, then reap the seeds some time later, and calculate our score
                        for each of the seed locations based on how quickly/ how well the plant actually grew.
                    </p>
                    <p>So our score function would become the reaction of the real minecraft environment, meaning that we get
                        a more accurate model of where is best to plant in our world</p>
                    <b>Challenges</b>
                    <p>The malmo API does present a number of challenges when considering our project scope/ farming in minecraft
                        in general. These include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Farming itself in minecraft is binary: although there are several "levels" of growth which would be useful for scoring the
                            rate of the growth at a particular square, either the crop has grown or it hasn't, as far as
                            the game is concerned when reaping the crops, meaning that rate of growth is difficult/ impossible
                            to obtain with just the in-game APIs, meaning we would need some kind of computer vision solution
                            to find whether one plant has outgrown another (unless one of the plants has grown and one hasn't).
                        </li>
                        <li>One of the biggest problems is planting and reaping consistently: we have noticed that, using the
                            current teleport function, planting a seed on a square and then trying to reap it later from
                            that same sqaure doesnt always work, because items are thrust into the air when reaped. To mitigate
                            this, we could make the player move around the square the plant was reaped in, so that the agent
                            is more likely to pick up the crop.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Map Exploration</b>
                    <p>Inherently, the seeds are generated from the best seeds of the current round: so they will converge on
                        the point(s) found by the best seed (s) in the first few rounds. </p>
                    <p>But what happens if all of the seeds are generated in a very bad location?</p>
                    <p>Currently to prevent this from happending, some "variance" vector is added to a point at the end of each
                        round, which we included as the "mutation" aspect of the genetic algorithm with the hope of exploring
                        the map slightly. However this doesnt quite solve the problem of making sure the map is explored
                        if all seeds are generated on one side of the map, which means that we could end up converging on
                        a minumum point in our map.
                    </p>
                    <p>To solve this we will implement a smarter mutation algorithm: one improvement we have been considering
                        is crossing over (breeding) two points from our "elite" set that are a maximum distance away, then
                        taking the x co-ordiante from one parent and the y co-ordinate from the other parent. This means
                        that the seed ends up in a totally new place for at least some seed generations, especially at the
                        starting rounds.
                    </p>
                    <p>Another mutation improvment could be something similar to the above, but instead taking the midpoints
                        between the two furthest points. The best strategy, for overall best coverage of the map, could be
                        a combination of the two techniques.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Convergence</b>
                    <p>At the moment, the genetic algorithm runs for 10 rounds. This was chosen through trial and error: when
                        testing, it was found that this is the rough figure that the seeds converge on for this map. However
                        a more rigorous definition of a cut off point must be found so that the algorithm can scale over
                        to other maps. </p>

                    <p>Defining when our algorithm converges comes down to determining how much difference there is between
                        successive generations. If all of the seed locations plants of the next generation have only moved
                        by one square, the chances are that the algorithm has now converged and there is no need to continue.
                    </p>
                </li>

            </ul>

            <h1>Evaluation of the current agent</h1>
            <p>Below we evaluate our current agent compared to a random agent</p>

            <p>
                <b>Evaluation Method:</b> Our aim in this section of the project was to beat a random agent with our genetic
                algorithm. So to test whether we were successful, we:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>First ran our random agent for 10 seperate games to get a baseline score</li>
                <li>We then ran our genetic algorithm for 10 seperate rounds to see how the scores compares</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The scores are summarsied in the chart below:</p>
            <div class="col-12">
                <img src="success_rate.PNG" />
            </div>
            <p>The blue bars in the chart above represent the random agent. As you can see, on every trial of the algorithm,
                it underperformed compared to our algorithm. Interestingly, if we csalculate the average of the scores of
                the random agent, we get exactly 2 / 10, or 20%, which is very close to the estimated 18% earlier. If we
                did more trials, we would find that eventually the success rate of the random agent would tend to 18%.
            </p>
            <p>Our genetic algorithm was very successful in this case, mostly planting 10 seeds in the optimal zone. The average
                overall came to roughly 9.2/10.</p>
            <p>It is also interesting to see how to seeds converge on the water block. Below is a charting of different stages
                of the algorithm and how it progresses</p>
