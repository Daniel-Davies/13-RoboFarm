        <h1>Summary of the project</h1>
        <p>We are essentially creating an AI to find the best points of farmland on a map to plant wheat crops in. Results from
            farming in minecraft can vary greatly based on a number of criteria, which our agent will use to evaluate positions
            on the map for checking optimal positions. These criteria include:</p>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Terrain: which block you place seeds on directly influences crop yield</li>
            <li>Proximity to water: the closer to a river/water, the faster crops grow</li>
            <li>Light: even if artificial, more light generally means a higher crop yield</li>
            <li>Material Additions: Materials like Bone Meal can help make crop yield faster</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Given these criteria, we are using a Genetic Algorithm to search for the optimal planting positions for wheat crops
            in a minecraft world to get a maximum amount of crop yield for a given time frame </p>


        <h1>Approach</h1>
        <p>We will be using a Genetic Algorithm to solve this problem, which essentially involved mapping the problem to a graph
            search problem and following the procedure for a genetic algorithm to allow our seeds to converge onto an optimal
            location.
        </p>
        <h5>Setup</h5>
        <p>To set the agent up with what it needs, we do the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>First, for this MVP version of our project, we generate a very simple world, which is essentally a square grid
                containing:
                <ol>
                    <li>A water square at (0,0)</li>
                    <li>Dirt around the water from (-10,10) in the (x,z) directions</li>
                </ol>
                This has the implication of creating
                <em>hydrated</em> water from (-4,4) by minecraft rules [aka the "optimal" part of the map] and leaving the remaining
                dirt squares as dry, and non optimal to plant on.
            </li>
            <li>The agent is given a range of squares to plant in, which for our purposes, could be any of the squares in (-10,10):
                and now the agent should be successful in planting in the hydrated squares by use of the genetic algorithm
                and our score function
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Now our agent is given 10 seeds, and can do one of 2 methods:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>we wrote a function that plants seeds randomly, to measure a baseline performace. In a world of (-10,10) dirt
                blocks,discluding the water block at the center, our agent can plant on 21*21 - 1 squares = 440, of which
                (-4,4) -> 9*9 - 1 = 80 are plantable. So theoretically, 18% is the random agent success rate for this map
                </li>
            <li>Plant using our algorithm, which is discussed below, and evaluated against this random agent</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Algorithm</h5>
        <p>Our algorithm will essentially simulate placing the seeds on the map, and evaluate this potential placement using
            our scoring function. It will do this until convergence. The steps are as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>We initialise 10 random seed locations, stored as (x,z) tuples</li>
            <li>For 10 rounds, we do:
                <ul>
                    <li>score the current seed locations</li>
                    <li>take 5 "elite" seeds: that is, the best scoring seeds from the group. These 5 seeds automatically pass
                        to the next round of seed locations
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        using the same 5 best seeds, generate 5 new children seeds by using their attributes. In this simple version of our algorithm,
                        we essentially randomly take the x and z co-ordinate from either of the parents. This is a simple
                        approach, but is quite effective is generating good results, accoring to
                        <a

                    </li>
                    <li>The 5 best seed locations are taken along with the new 5 children, ready for the next round</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>At the end of the generation of seed locations, we have a list of (x,z) pairs to place our seeds. We then plant
                these, and visually inspect how much crop yield we got/ how many of the seeds were placed in the (-4,4) hydrated
                farmland section.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Goals/Evaluation</h1>

        <p>We have prepared a number of goals to reach:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>MVP: We want the AI to realise that planting on hydrated farmland is best, and avoid planting on rock or other
                kinds of unplantable materials. This should guarantee us a "better than random" result</li>
            <li>We would also like our algorithm to cluster seeds together on optimal land, since clustering plants together
                in rows/ columns also means they will grow faster</li>
            <li>Finally we will try and allow the AI to fix any plants that could not be planted on optimal soil by use of bone
                meal etc to speed up growth</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The more points we can cross off this list, the better we can say an agent is at farming, and the more trust a user
            would have in letting the AI manage the seeds a user has to reap rewards over a number of minecraft days.</p>

        <p>Input to our AI: The malmo API will let us generate worlds with a number of terrains, by paramters that we specify.
            Because we specify the parameters, we will have a mapping of the minecraft world we are in to give a sense of
            navigation to our agent.</p>

        <p>
            Output: at each round, the agent will produce a set of locations on the map that it believes to be optimal points for planting
            the seeds
        </p>

        <p>
            Applications: Essentially, the project allows a player to automate farming, which can take a long time in minecraft.
        </p>

        <P>
            Now that we have a goal and some variables, we can describe some stages:
        </P>

        <p>
            Stage one: how do we get our data/ input from the world?
        </p>

        <p>
            Malmo will provide us with the methods needed to read the world. This will be especially important to start when we teach
            our AI about the terrain that it should plant on. We will most likely initialise a world conatining a number
            of terrains, e.g. Rock, Grass, and Ploughed Grass, and give our agent a list of where each of these blocks are
            so that it can score each location.
        </p>
        <p>The scoring function</p>
        <p>
            Initially we would like to keep it simple and leave our scoring function as a representation of how close a block is to water
            Later on however we would like to actually execute a generation of our genetic algorithm in malmo, then reap
            the crops at the locations that our AI has chosen, and the amount of wheat we obtain is the score. This should
            hopefully get better with every round.
        </p>
        <p>
            What to expect: Crops closest to water and torches grow fastest</p>
        <p>
            Output: A set of locations that our agent can reap, followed by a collection of wheat</p>
        <p>Progress Tracking: We will use an agent that plants completely randomly as a baseline and measure our performace
            relative to this</p>
