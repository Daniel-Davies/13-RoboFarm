        <h1>Minecraft Farming AI</h1>
        <p>Farming in minecraft can be quite a time consuming process, that involves quite a number of variables. For this reason,
            we are hoping to make an agent that can automate it for the user.</p>

        <h1>Summary of the project</h1>
        <p>There are quite a number of variables involved in farming in minecraft. These include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Terrain: which block you place seeds on directly influences crop yield</li>
            <li>Proximity to water: the closer to a river/water, the faster crops grow</li>
            <li>Light: even if artificial, more light generally means a higher crop yield</li>
            <li>Material Additions: Materials like Bone Meal can help make crop yield faster</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We have prepared a number of goals to reach:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>MVP: We want the AI to realise that planting on hydrated farmland is best, and avoid planting on rock or other
                kinds of unplantable materials</li>
            <li>We would like our algorithm to cluster seeds together on optimal land, since this means they will grow faster</li>
            <li>Finally we will try and allow the AI to fix any plants that could not be planted on optimal soil by use of bone
                meal etc to speed up growth</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The more points we can cross off this list, the better we can say an agent is at farming, and the more trust a user
            would have in letting the AI manage the seeds a user has to reap rewards over a number of minecraft days.</p>

        <p>Input to our AI: The malmo API will let us generate worlds with a number of terrains, by parameters that we specify.
            Because we specify the parameters, we will have a mapping of the minecraft world we are in to give a sense of
            navigation to our agent.</p>

        <p>
            Output: at each round, the agent will produce a set of locations on the map that it believes to be optimal points for planting
            the seeds
        </p>

        <p>
            Applications: Essentially, the project allows a player to automate farming, which can take a long time in minecraft.
        </p>

        <P>
            Now that we have a goal and some variables, we can describe some stages:
        </P>

        <p>
            Stage one: how do we get our data/ input from the world?
        </p>

        <p>
            Malmo will provide us with the methods needed to read the world. This will be especially important to start when we teach
            our AI about the terrain that it should plant on. We will most likely initialise a world containing a number
            of terrains, e.g. Rock, Grass, and Ploughed Grass, and give our agent a list of where each of these blocks are
            so that it can score each location.
        </p>
        <p>The scoring function</p>
        <p>
            Initially we would like to keep it simple and leave our scoring function as a representation of how close a block is to water
            Later on however we would like to actually execute a generation of our genetic algorithm in malmo, then reap
            the crops at the locations that our AI has chosen, and the amount of wheat we obtain is the score. This should
            hopefully get better with every round.
        </p>
        <p>
            What to expect: Crops closest to water and torches grow fastest</p>
        <p>
            Output: A set of locations that our agent can reap, followed by a collection of wheat</p>
        <p>Progress Tracking: We will use an agent that plants completely randomly as a baseline and measure our performace
            relative to this</p>

        <h1>Algorithms</h1>
        <p>A genetic algorithm</p>
        <h1>Evaluation plan</h1>
        <p>The primary metric evaluating the performance of our agent will be the total amount of wheat collected during the
            testing period. A possible secondary metric could be how many seeds were used, allowing the agent to learn efficient
            seed usage. </p>
        <p> The baseline farming performance to start comparing against will be a completely random agent - one that simply randomly
            distributes the seeds across the given grid. With a fully trained model, we expect to be able to improve the
            baseline performance by 50%. The trained agent and baseline model will be tested and compared on a large set
            of grids representing farming plots. Each grid will be designed to illustrate certain in-game farming mechanics.</p>
        <p>
            We will obtain qualitative proof that the algorithm is functional by testing it on never been seen grids and confirming its
            ability to learn the terrain and mechanics to farm effectively.
        </p>
        <p>
            One simple sanity checking case would be to run the algorithm on a simple grid filled mostly with stone and one small patch
            of ploughed land. In theory, the agent should easily learn to only plant in that one area to maximize its rewards.
        </p>
        <p>
            We can visualise our agent by making it plant our current best prediction of optimal farming spots and seeing how quickly
            the wheat grows in those locations. As the number of rounds increases, the predictions should be getting better,
            and the wheat should visually be growing faster.
        </p>
